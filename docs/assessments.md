# Assessments & Evaluation  
How You Earn Your Place Among the Top 1% of Robotics Engineers in 2025

This program does **not** grade you on theory.  
It grades you on **what you can make a robot do in the real world**.

| Component                            | Weight | What You Deliver (Real, Public, Verifiable)                                                                                   | Deadline          |
|--------------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Weekly Quizzes + Coding Challenges** | 10%   | 8-15 minute auto-graded quizzes + small, working ROS 2 nodes (publishers, services, actions, launch files, URDFs, etc.)     | Every Sunday 23:59 |
| **Weekly Lab Submissions**           | 20%   | Fully functional, well-documented GitHub repos for every lab (Gazebo worlds, Isaac ROS pipelines, Unity bridges, etc.)      | Weekly            |
| **Midterm Project**                   | 25%   | **"Autonomous Mobile Manipulator in Simulation"**<br />• Complete URDF/Xacro + ros2_control<br />• Nav2 + SLAM (Cartographer/SLAM Toolbox)<br />• Isaac ROS perception &ge;80 Hz<br />• Pick-and-place with MoveIt2<br />• 3-minute polished demo video + public GitHub repo | End of Week 7     |
| **Capstone Project (Final)**          | 40%   | **"Vision-Language-Action Intelligent Agent"** — the crown jewel of your portfolio<br />Mandatory deliverables:<br />• Fine-tuned OpenVLA-7B or Octo on your own dataset (50-500 demos)<br />• &ge;6 complex language tasks working in sim **and** real hardware (if possible)<br />• Speech input (Whisper) + speech output (Piper/ElevenLabs)<br />• Real-time inference &ge;15 Hz on Jetson Orin / RTX<br />• 4-6 minute cinematic YouTube demo<br />• Public GitHub repo + HuggingFace model + detailed report (12-20 pages) | End of Week 13    |
