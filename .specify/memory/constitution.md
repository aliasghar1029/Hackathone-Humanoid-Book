# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Deliverable Focus
The primary deliverable is a Docusaurus classic site, deployed on GitHub Pages, precisely replicating a 9-page PDF content. All development efforts must align with achieving this deliverable.

### II. Content Fidelity & Presentation
Content must maintain exact fidelity to the original 9-page PDF. All Markdown must be clean and professional. Tables must render perfectly across all supported platforms.

### III. User Experience & Accessibility
The Docusaurus site must adhere to a mobile-first design philosophy, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction on small screens before scaling up.

### IV. Technical Architecture & Extensibility
The project structure and implementation must inherently support future integration with a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) chatbot, emphasizing clear data models and accessible content.

### V. Hackathon Compliance
All project aspects, from implementation to documentation, must strictly adhere to the Panaversity Hackathon I base requirements to achieve the maximum 100 points.

## Project Scope and Deliverables

This project focuses on delivering a Docusaurus classic site for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook content. The site will be hosted on GitHub Pages and will exactly reproduce the content of a provided 9-page PDF. Future extensibility for RAG chatbot integration is a core architectural consideration.

## Development Standards

Development practices must ensure clean, professional Markdown, perfect rendering of tables, and a mobile-first design approach. Adherence to coding standards and best practices is paramount to ensure maintainability and quality.

## Governance
This Constitution outlines the guiding principles and requirements for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook project. It supersedes all other conflicting practices or guidelines. Amendments to this Constitution require documentation, approval, and a clear migration plan for any impacted components. Compliance will be reviewed regularly.
